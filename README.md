# AR and Deep Learning based Automatic Human Body Measurement System

Based on a recent “fit” study, almost one-third of diaper users wear the wrong diaper size, while four out of ten mothers state that diaper fit is a significant concern at every stage of diapering. Despite disposable diapers being around for the last half-century, ensuring proper fit of diapers for babies can be confusing for parents. When babies wear the wrong diaper size, the chances of leakage and blowouts increase. Kimberly-Clark continues to partner with parents to not just provide a diaper that fits their baby perfectly, but also provide the technology and tools needed to reduce diaper fit challenges.<br>
## Objective
This project is aimed to provide a reliable solution for the parents to know the correct baby's body measurements to get right size diaper and clothing and get future size prediction.
## Solution:
This projects presents an unique body measurement system based on AR and ML technology.<br>
AR measurement is taken using ARKit and/or ARCore technology to measure distance between two key-points on the body.<br>
Keypoints are detected on an remote side server from ML based pose estimation and edge keypoint recognition. These keypoints are send back to the server side device and measurements are taken.<br>
